# Manual Arithemetic

In some instances, the given compilier is unable to process the multiplication or divison of extremely large numbers. Now, while there may be ways to go around this, through importing external libaries, I decided to develop a program that would treat the two numbers like strings, and use the traditional column/grid multiplication and divison method we were taught in elementary school. 

The program itself is compact, and essentialy highlights the algorithmic procedure and nature of elementary multiplication/division. 

To use them, simply enter the two numbers required (and for the divsion the level of accuracy), and enjoy!
