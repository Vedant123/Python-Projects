# Palindromes

Palindromes are essentially strings that are spelt the same forwards and backwards. Many popular instances of these exist in the English language, such as "Racecar", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?", and more. 

In this python file, I simply implemented an algorithm to run through a given input string and compute regarding whether or not the text is a palindrome. 

However, there are certain considerations that must be accounted for when developing this tool. As completely pure palindromes (same letter case, puncuation, etc.) are extremely difficult to find naturally, there are certain considerations incorporated to neglect such cases, for instance:

  - Letter case (Capital or Non-Capital Letters), will be disregarded
  - Extraneous puncuation will be neglected (e.g. Commas and Question Marks)
  - Spacing will not be considered
